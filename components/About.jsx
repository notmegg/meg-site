      Hi, I'm Meghana, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at REVA University. Ever since I got into computers, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of domains and have tried my best to embrace each one. While I do have my preferences, I make sure that I have a positive attitude while I make my way through uncharted waters. I find it fun to learn and adapt to new concepts and add my two cents whenever possible.

      My tendency to explore various subjects without focusing on just one extends to my other interests as well. I find myself trying out new things to occupy myself with, although sometimes it's a challenge to keep up with them. Reading has been an interest of mine since childhood and has now evolved to include digital media too. I thoroughly enjoy all kinds of music, have performed on multiple occasions, and have also tried my hand at creating it. I have experimented with embroidery and art as well, though my skill levels don't really match my enthusiasm. I've also tried my hand at different sports, dabbled in dancing and even attempted to learn the guitar, which now stares at me as a sad reminder of my dream of being in a band. Ultimately I keep going through the cycle of exploring new things, making mistakes and learning from them, while I try to make it as fun as possible ^^
