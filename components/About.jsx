        Hello, I'm Meghana, and I'm currently a final-year Computer Science
        major at Reva University. Throughout my journey in CS, I've had the
        opportunity to explore a wide range of domains, and I've consistently
        embraced each one. By diving into different domains, I've gained a
        versatile skill set, making me label myself as a 'Jack of All Trades'.
        While I do have my preferences, I try to maintain a proactive attitude
        towards tackling any challenge that comes my way, even if it's
        unfamiliar territory. I'm enthusiastic about learning and adapting to
        new concepts and contribute effectively. </p>

        My habit of inconsistency extends beyond academics into my hobbies as
        well. Despite my best intentions, I find myself juggling numerous
        interests that sometimes struggle to keep track of. I have cultivated a
        habit of reading since childhood which has now evolved into the realm of
        digital media, particularly mangas, manhwas and digital novels. I
        thoroughly enjoy music of all kinds and have even had the pleasure of
        performing on multiple occasions. I enjoy exploring new areas like
        embroidery and drawing and although my skill levels do not match my
        enthusiasm, it doesn't stop me from trying them anyway. Ultimately, I
        love exploring new things, facing challenges, learning from them and
        eagerly look forward to what's to come ^^
